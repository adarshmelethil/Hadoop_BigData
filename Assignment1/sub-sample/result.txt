but as the riper should by time decease,	
thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:	
thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,	
then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,	
now is the time that face should form another,	
of his self-love to stop posterity?	
calls back the lovely april of her prime,	
then were not summer's distillation left	
7	
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,	
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,	
and threescore year would make the world away:	
harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:	
thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.	
and your sweet semblance to some other give.	
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.	
and all in war with time for love of you,	
now stand you on the top of happy hours,	
and your true rights be termed a poet's rage,	
19	
my love shall in my verse ever live young.	
20	
an eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:	
stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,	
making a couplement of proud compare	
with april's first-born flowers and all things rare,	
my glass shall not persuade me i am old,	
as an unperfect actor on the stage,	
the perfect ceremony of love's rite,	
more than that tongue that more hath more expressed.	
to find where your true image pictured lies,	
where i may not remove nor be removed.	
duty so great, which wit so poor as mine	
points on me graciously with fair aspect,	
makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.	
28	
how can i then return in happy plight	
that am debarred the benefit of rest?	
i all alone beweep my outcast state,	
from sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,	
their images i loved, i view in thee,	
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:	
and they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.	
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.	
so shall those blots that do with me remain,	
entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,	
so then i am not lame, poor, nor despised,	
38	
while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse,	
o give thy self the thanks if aught in me,	
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring:	
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before?	
hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,	
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly,	
when most i wink then do mine eyes best see,	
how would thy shadow's form, form happy show,	
how would (i say) mine eyes be blessed made,	
all days are nights to see till i see thee,	
in tender embassy of love to thee,	
my life being made of four, with two alone,	
by those swift messengers returned from thee,	
and says in him thy fair appearance lies.	
thy self away, art present still with me,	
48	
to guard the lawful reasons on thy part,	
doth teach that case and that repose to say	
plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,	
from where thou art, why should i haste me thence?	
when swift extremity can seem but slow?	
by new unfolding his imprisoned pride.	
blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,	
is poorly imitated after you,	
speak of the spring, and foison of the year,	
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give!	
the rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem	
and so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,	
the living record of your memory.	
you live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.	
let this sad interim like the ocean be	
come daily to the banks, that when they see:	
i have no precious time at all to spend;	
not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.	
even of five hundred courses of the sun,	
to subjects worse have given admiring praise.	
61	
is it thy will, thy image should keep open	
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake,	
with lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn	
stealing away the treasure of his spring:	
for such a time do i now fortify	
whose action is no stronger than a flower?	
against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days,	
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,	
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now,	
the right of sepulchres, were shorn away,	
and him as for a map doth nature store,	
thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,	
but why thy odour matcheth not thy show,	
a crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.	
thy worth the greater being wooed of time,	
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,	
but let your love even with my life decay.	
what merit lived in me that you should love	
for i am shamed by that which i bring forth,	
and so should you, to love things nothing worth.	
consumed with that which it was nourished by.	
so are you to my thoughts as food to life,	
doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,	
then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,	
and by and by clean starved for a look,	
to new-found methods, and to compounds strange?	
spending again what is already spent:	
of mouthed graves will give thee memory,	
and found such fair assistance in my verse,	
from thy behaviour, beauty doth he give	
since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.	
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,	
or i shall live your epitaph to make,	
and tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,	
when all the breathers of this world are dead,	
thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,	
but he that writes of you, if he can tell,	
but that is in my thought, whose love to you	
bound for the prize of (all too precious) you,	
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?	
i was not sick of any fear from thence.	
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,	
88	
to linger out a purposed overthrow.	
compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.	
some glory in their birth, some in their skill,	
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,	
o what a happy title do i find,	
93	
for there can live no hatred in thine eye,	
and husband nature's riches from expense,	
for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,	
to truths translated, and for true things deemed.	
if like a lamb he could his looks translate!	
what old december's bareness everywhere!	
when proud-pied april (dressed in all his trim)	
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing:	
give my love fame faster than time wastes life,	
both truth and beauty on my love depends:	
make answer muse, wilt thou not haply say,	
the argument all bare is of more worth	
your own glass shows you, when you look in it.	
for as you were when first your eye i eyed,	
such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,	
have from the forests shook three summers' pride,	
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,	
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green.	
105	
in praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,	
of this our time, all you prefiguring,	
they had not skill enough your worth to sing:	
incertainties now crown themselves assured,	
what's new to speak, what now to register,	
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,	
so that my self bring water for my stain,	
and made my self a motley to the view,	
thence comes it that my name receives a brand,	
to what it works in, like the dyer's hand:	
no bitterness that i will bitter think,	
for what care i who calls me well or ill,	
to critic and to flatterer stopped are:	
that all the world besides methinks are dead.	
and that which governs me to go about,	
doth part his function, and is partly blind,	
114	
those lines that i before have writ do lie,	
might i not then say 'now i love you best,'	
admit impediments, love is not love	
whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.	
wherein i should your great deserts repay,	
forgot upon your dearest love to call,	
to be diseased ere that there was true needing.	
and brought to medicine a healthful state	
120	
o that our night of woe might have remembered	
121	
that poor retention could not so much hold,	
thy registers and thee i both defy,	
which works on leases of short-numbered hours,	
which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.	
or laid great bases for eternity,	
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,	
and her quietus is to render thee.

for nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,	
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?

if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,	
if thou turn back and my loud crying still.	
the better angel is a man right fair:	
to me that languished for her sake:	
straight in her heart did mercy come,	
and let that pine to aggravate thy store;	
nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend	
that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?	
my nobler part to my gross body's treason,

in act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,

king henry. my lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,	
northumberland. if i be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!	
clifford. the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel.	
clifford. whom should he follow but his natural king?	
northumberland. yes, warwick, i remember it to my grief;	
thy father was, as thou art, duke of york;	
let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.	
and now in england to our heart's great sorrow,	
my title's good, and better far than his.

and if thine eyes can water for his death,	
i prithee grieve to make me merry, york.	
hold you his hands whilst i do set it on.	
ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!	
ay, this is he that took king henry's chair,	
but that thy face is visard-like, unchanging,	
were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.	
queen margaret. what, weeping-ripe, my lord northumberland?	
a plain near mortimer's cross in herefordshire	
had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;	
or had he scap'd, methinks we should have heard	
as if they vow'd some league inviolable.	
in this the heaven figures some event.	
edward. o, speak no more! for i have heard too much.	
who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,	
they set the same; and there it doth remain,	
for never henceforth shall i joy again;	
scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart;	
tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me!	
richard. nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,	
our baleful news and at each word's deliverance	
and very well appointed, as i thought,

richard. i know it well, lord warwick; blame me not.	
now if the help of norfolk and myself,	
edward. then strike up drums. god and saint george for us!	
warwick. how now! what news?	
queen margaret. welcome, my lord, to this brave town of york.	
that sought to be encompass'd with your crown.	
doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?	
nor wittingly have i infring'd my vow.	
and long hereafter say unto his child	
for all the rest is held at such a rate	
ah, cousin york! would thy best friends did know	
i'll draw it as apparent to the crown,	
and set thy diadem upon my head,	
becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms	
to blot out me and put his own son in.	
clifford. and reason too:	
warwick. then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.	
the execution of my big-swol'n heart	
queen margaret. defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.	
for york in justice puts his armour on.	
richard. whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;	
sham'st thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,	
that wash'd his father's fortunes forth of france	
and though the edge hath something hit ourselves,	
we'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,	
edward. and in this resolution i defy thee;	
enter george	
george. our hap is lost, our hope but sad despair;	
that stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,	
and look upon, as if the tragedy	
till either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine	
where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.	
i that did never weep now melt with woe	
for yet is hope of life and victory.

to execute the like upon thyself;	
and so, have at thee!                           [they fight]	
for i myself will hunt this wolf to death.            exeunt

for what is in this world but grief and woe?	
o god! methinks it were a happy life	
to be no better than a homely swain;	
so many hours must i sport myself;	
his body couched in a curious bed,	
may be possessed with some store of crowns;	
who's this? o god! it is my father's face,	
and i, who at his hands receiv'd my life,	
weep, wretched man; i'll aid thee tear for tear;	
what stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,	
o boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,	
exit with the body	
king henry. sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,	
with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,	
exeter. away! for vengeance comes along with them.	
whither the queen intends. forward; away!             exeunt	
clifford. here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,	
for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?	
that led calm henry, though he were a king,	
who not contented that he lopp'd the branch	
and his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.	
richard. clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.	
warwick. clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.	
this hand should chop it off, and with the issuing blood	
and now to london with triumphant march,	
richard, be duke of gloucester. now to london	
second keeper. i'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.	
king henry. from scotland am i stol'n, even of pure love,	
second keeper. why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.	
to wife for edward. if this news be true,	
her sighs will make a batt'ry in his breast;	
he, on his right, asking a wife for edward.	
second keeper. well, if you be a king crown'd with content,	
and you were sworn true subjects unto me;	
to go with us unto the officers.	
the worthy gentleman did lose his life.	
i see the lady hath a thing to grant,	
keeps the wind!	
gloucester. [aside to clarence] silence!	
leave	
king edward. i'll tell you how these lands are to be got.	
king edward. but you will take exceptions to my boon.	
clarence. as red as fire! nay, then her wax must melt.	
lady grey. why, then you mean not as i thought you did.	
but, mighty lord, this merry inclination	
gloucester. the widow likes him not; she knits her brows.	
to be the father unto many sons.	
exeunt all but gloucester	
is clarence, henry, and his son young edward,	
and all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,	
to disproportion me in every part,	
and whiles i live t' account this world but hell,	
and yet i know not how to get the crown,	
for many lives stand between me and home;	
that rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns,	
why, i can smile, and murder whiles i smile,	
deceive more slily than ulysses could,	
must strike her sail and learn a while to serve	
and to my humble seat conform myself.	
our treasure seiz'd, our soldiers put to flight,	
lewis. renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,	
lewis. the more i stay, the more i'll succour thee.	
lewis. what's he approacheth boldly to our presence?	
queen margaret. [aside] if that go forward, henry's hope is done.	
to tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;	
springs not from edward's well-meant honest love,	
thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;	
for though usurpers sway the rule a while	
who by his prowess conquered all france.	
to make prescription for a kingdom's worth.	
oxford. call him my king by whose injurious doom	
even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,	
vouchsafe at our request to stand aside	
is edward your true king? for i were loath	
unless the lady bona quit his pain.	
draw near, queen margaret, and be a witness	
from giving aid which late i promised.	
oxford. i like it well that our fair queen and mistress	
prince of wales. nay, mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled.	
warwick. mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.	
warwick. king lewis, i here protest in sight of heaven,	
and am i guerdon'd at the last with shame?	
and as for clarence, as my letters tell me,	
queen margaret. renowned prince, how shall poor henry live	
bona. tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,	
and prince shall follow with a fresh supply.	
what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?	
that if our queen and this young prince agree,	
son edward, she is fair and virtuous,	
prince of wales. yes, i accept her, for she well deserves it;	
and thou, lord bourbon, our high admiral,	
of this new marriage with the lady grey?	
that you stand pensive as half malcontent?	
no, god forbid that i should wish them sever'd	
to sunder them that yoke so well together.	
montague. yet to have join'd with france in such alliance	
hastings. 'tis better using france than trusting france.	
gloucester. and yet methinks your grace hath not done well	
clarence. in choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment,	
and to that end i shortly mind to leave you.	
queen elizabeth. my lords, before it pleas'd his majesty	
to raise my state to title of a queen,	
messenger. my sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,	
tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.	
'go tell false edward, the supposed king,	
messenger. these were her words, utt'red with mild disdain:	
king edward. i blame not her: she could say little less;	
she had the wrong. but what said henry's queen?	
but what said warwick to these injuries?	
gloucester. [aside] not i.	
and haste is needful in this desp'rate case.	
but if you mind to hold your true obedience,	
king edward. now, brother richard, will you stand by us?	
speak suddenly, my lords- are we all friends?	
we may surprise and take him at our pleasure?	
you that will follow me to this attempt,	
till warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.	
third watchman. o, is it so? but why commands the king	
second watchman. ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent	
thou call'dst me king?	
of thee thyself and all thy complices,	
now for a while farewell, good duke of york.	
london. the palace	
either betray'd by falsehood of his guard	
rivers. but, madam, where is warwick then become?	
queen elizabeth. i am inform'd that he comes towards london	
leave off to wonder why i drew you hither	
lieutenant. subjects may challenge nothing of their sov'reigns;	
nay, be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness,	
and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee;	
adjudg'd an olive branch and laurel crown,	
warwick. and i choose clarence only for protector.	
while i myself will lead a private life	
be sent for to return from france with speed;	
suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,	
likely in time to bless a regal throne.	
as henry's late presaging prophecy	
oxford. ay, for if edward repossess the crown,	
come therefore, let's about it speedily.              exeunt	
king edward. now, brother richard, lord hastings, and the rest,	
for many men that stumble at the threshold	
i doubt not, i, but we shall soon persuade	
montgomery. to help king edward in his time of storm,	
gloucester. and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.	
montgomery. ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;	
soldier. [reads] 'edward the fourth, by the grace of god,

men well inclin'd to hear what thou command'st.	
or modest dian circled with her nymphs,	
cousin of exeter, what thinks your lordship?	
then why should they love edward more than me?	
enter king edward, gloucester, and soldiers	
somerville. at southam i did leave him with his forces,	
and henry is my king, warwick his subject.	
if not, the city being but of small defence,	
[he and his forces enter the city]	
with whom an upright zeal to right prevails	
more than the nature of a brother's love.	
clarence. clarence, clarence, for lancaster!	
i will not ruinate my father's house,	
i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe;	
with resolution whereso'er i meet thee-	
[march. warwick and his company follow]	
warwick. ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,	
have been as piercing as the mid-day sun	
and who durst smile when warwick bent his brow?	
what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?	
somerset. ah, warwick, warwick! wert thou as we are,	
we might recover all our loss again.	
[here they bear away his body]	
and we are grac'd with wreaths of victory.	
but in the midst of this bright-shining day	
king edward. are advertis'd by our loving friends	
we, having now the best at barnet field,	
plains wear tewksbury	
and richard but a ragged fatal rock?	
and make him naked foil a man-at-arms.	
let him depart before we need his help.	
somerset. and he that will not fight for such a hope,	
queen margaret. thanks, gentle somerset; sweet oxford, thanks.	
flourish and march. enter, at a distance, king edward,	
oxford. for my part, i'll not trouble thee with words.	
shall have a high reward, and he his life?	
gloucester. it is; and lo where youthful edward comes.

prince of wales. let aesop fable in a winter's night;	
king edward. take that, the likeness of this railer here.

gloucester. marry, and shall.             [offers to kill her]	
gloucester. clarence, excuse me to the king my brother.	
the thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse.	
king edward. where's richard gone?	
enter king henry and gloucester with the lieutenant, on the walls	
gloucester. sirrah, leave us to ourselves; we must confer.	
gloucester. suspicion always haunts the guilty mind:	
to wit, an indigest deformed lump,	
not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.	
king henry. ay, and for much more slaughter after this.	
down, down to hell; and say i sent thee thither-	
[stabs him again]	
the midwife wonder'd; and the women cried

we'll send mark antony to the senate house,

which, pardon me, i do not mean to read-	
i have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.

you gave me this; but take it, sir, again.

o, here it is. uncle, i must come forth.	
or, naked as i am, i will assault thee.	
lodovico. where is this rash and most unfortunate man?	
lodovico. o thou othello, that wert once so good,	
lodovico. what, not to pray?	
and here another. the one of them imports	
but that, belike, iago in the interim	
lodovico. you must forsake this room, and go with us.	
speak of me as i am; nothing extenuate,	
nor set down aught in malice. then must you speak	
like the base indian, threw a pearl away

thomas mowbray, duke of norfolk	
earl of salisbury	
duke of gloucester	
in the devotion of a subject's love,	
or my divine soul answer it in heaven-	
mowbray. let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.	
yet can i not of such tame patience boast	
as to be hush'd and nought at an to say.	
bolingbroke. pale trembling coward, there i throw my gage,	
and lay aside my high blood's royalty,	
thomas of norfolk, what say'st thou to this?	
he is our subject, mowbray; so art thou:	
disburs'd i duly to his highness' soldiers;	
for you, my noble lord of lancaster,	
which in myself i boldly will defend,	
deep malice makes too deep incision.	
our doctors say this is no month to bleed.	
king richard. and, norfolk, throw down his.	
gaunt. when, harry, when?	
king richard. norfolk, throw down; we bid.	
my life thou shalt command, but not my shame:	
despite of death, that lives upon my grave	
give me his gage-lions make leopards tame.	
king richard. we were not born to sue, but to command;	
which since we cannot do to make you friends,	
be ready, as your lives shall answer it,	
will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.	
edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,	
is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,	
duchess. where then, alas, may i complain myself?	
with her companion, grief, must end her life.	
not with the empty hollowness, but weight.	
lo, this is all- nay, yet depart not so;	
therefore commend me; let him not come there	
aumerle. why then, the champions are prepar'd, and stay	
to swear him in the justice of his cause.	
both to defend my loyalty and truth	
depose him in the justice of his cause.	
except the marshal and such officers	
then let us take a ceremonious leave	
farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,	
and with thy blessings steel my lance's point,	
most mighty liege, and my companion peers,	
order the trial, marshal, and begin.	
second herald. here standeth thomas mowbray, duke of norfolk,	
of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;	
or, being open, put into his hands	
doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;	
bolingbroke. norfolk, so far as to mine enemy.	
flourish. exit king with train	
the precious jewel of thy home return.	
look what thy soul holds dear, imagine it	
suppose the singing birds musicians,	
the flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more	
my mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!	
king richard. what said our cousin when you parted with him?	
to counterfeit oppression of such grief	
wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles	
for our affairs in hand. if that come short,	
act ii. scene i.	
gaunt. will the king come, that i may breathe my last	
as praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,	
he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;	
light vanity, insatiate cormorant,	
of wat'ry neptune, is now bound in with shame,	
how happy then were my ensuing death!	
for young hot colts being rag'd do rage the more.	
the pleasure that some fathers feed upon	
gaunt. no, misery makes sport to mock itself:	
king richard. i am in health, i breathe, and see thee ill.	
which art possess'd now to depose thyself.	
now by my seat's right royal majesty,	
my brother gloucester, plain well-meaning soul-	
that thou respect'st not spilling edward's blood.	
northumberland. my liege, old gaunt commends him to your majesty.	
but only they have privilege to live.	
whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess'd.	
or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.	
of whom thy father, prince of wales, was first.	
his face thou hast, for even so look'd he,	
did win what he did spend, and spent not that	
the royalties and rights of banish'd hereford?	
was not gaunt just? and is not harry true?	
for he is just, and always lov'd us well.	
if it be so, out with it boldly, man;	
of noble blood in this declining land.	
for ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts.	
but basely yielded upon compromise	
that which his noble ancestors achiev'd with blows.	
but, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,	
sir john norbery, sir robert waterton, and francis quoint-	
but if you faint, as fearing to do so,	
as my sweet richard. yet again methinks	
is coming towards me, and my inward soul	
which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows	
of what it is not. then, thrice-gracious queen,	
'tis in reversion that i do possess-	
green. god save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen.	
queen. why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;	
bushy. why have you not proclaim'd northumberland	
and all the rest revolted faction traitors?	
who gently would dissolve the bands of life,	
york. he was-why so go all which way it will!	
bid her send me presently a thousand pound.	
come, sister-cousin, i would say-pray, pardon me.	
if i know how or which way to order these affairs	
proportionable to the enemy	
is near the hate of those love not the king.	
these high wild hills and rough uneven ways	
making the hard way sweet and delectable.	
in ross and willoughby, wanting your company,	
which, i protest, hath very much beguil'd	
than hope enjoy'd. by this the weary lords	
and sent me over by berkeley, to discover	
as in a soul rememb'ring my good friends;	
shall be your love and labour's recompense.	
willoughby. and far surmounts our labour to attain it.	
to you, my lord, i come-what lord you will-	
why have those banish'd and forbidden legs	
so many miles upon her peaceful bosom,	
but for his own; and for the right of that	
but since i cannot, be it known unto you	
bolingbroke. an offer, uncle, that we will accept.	
and yet we hear no tidings from the king;	
therefore we will disperse ourselves. farewell.	
rich men look sad, and ruffians dance and leap-	
farewell. our countrymen are gone and fled,	
witnessing storms to come, woe, and unrest;	
thy friends are fled, to wait upon thy foes;	
with too much urging your pernicious lives,	
save men's opinions and my living blood	
bolingbroke. my lord northumberland, see them dispatch'd.	
uncle, you say the queen is at your house;	
to stand upon my kingdom once again.	
dear earth, i do salute thee with my hand,	
though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs.	
in murders and in outrage boldly here;	
and darts his light through every guilty hole,	
stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?	
a glorious angel. then, if angels fight,	
aumerle. comfort, my liege; remember who you are.	
ye favourites of a king; are we not high?	
and what loss is it to be rid of care?	
the worst is death, and death will have his day.	
scroop. glad am i that your highness is so arm'd	
to bear the tidings of calamity.	
snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!	
again uncurse their souls; their peace is made	
let's choose executors and talk of wills;	
our lands, our lives, and an, are bolingbroke's.	
speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.	
your uncle york is join'd with bolingbroke;	
king richard. thou hast said enough.	
what say you now? what comfort have we now?	
by heaven, i'll hate him everlastingly	
lest you mistake. the heavens are over our heads.	
bolingbroke. royally!	
and with him are the lord aumerle, lord salisbury,	
into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:	
even at his feet to lay my arms and power,	
and lands restor'd again be freely granted;	
with no less terror than the elements	
to pay their awful duty to our presence?	
that hath dismiss'd us from our stewardship;	
her pastures' grass with faithful english blood.	
should so with civil and uncivil arms	
to faithful service of your majesty.	
on yon proud man should take it off again	
or that i could forget what i have been!	
or not remember what i must be now!	
the king shall be contented. must he lose	
the name of king? a god's name, let it go.	
bolingbroke. my gracious lord, i come but for mine own.	
king richard. well you deserve. they well deserve to have	
uncle, give me your hands; nay, dry your eyes:	
cousin, i am too young to be your father,	
what you will have, i'll give, and willing too;	
set on towards london. cousin, is it so?	
and what i want it boots not to complain.	
stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight;	
gardener. hold thy peace.	
gardener. they are; and bolingbroke	
hath seiz'd the wasteful king. o, what pity is it	
with too much riches it confound itself;	
to make a second fall of cursed man?	
cam'st thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.	
act iv. scene 1.	
enter, as to the parliament, bolingbroke, aumerle, northumberland, percy,	
fitzwater, surrey, the bishop of carlisle, the abbot of westminster,	
bolingbroke. cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.	
scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.	
with the attainder of his slanderous lips.	
aumerle. thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.	
fitzwater. now, by my soul, i would it were this hour.	
as may be halloa'd in thy treacherous ear	
fitzwater. surrey, thou liest.	
in proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;	
aumerle. some honest christian trust me with a gage	
streaming the ensign of the christian cross	
and, toil'd with works of war, retir'd himself	
bolingbroke. in god's name, i'll ascend the regal throne.	
of noble richard! then true noblesse would	
i speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,	
peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels,	
the field of golgotha and dead men's skulls.	
that ever fell upon this cursed earth.	
king richard. alack, why am i sent for to a king,	
to insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my knee.	
york. to do that office of thine own good will	
i give this heavy weight from off my head,	
god keep all vows unbroke are made to thee!	
god save king henry, unking'd richard says,	
to read a lecture of them? if thou wouldst,	
and water cannot wash away your sin.	
since it is bankrupt of his majesty.	
thou dost beguile me! was this face the face	
that like the sun did make beholders wink?	
'tis very true: my grief lies all within;	
and then be gone and trouble you no more.	
that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.	
to bury mine intents, but also to effect	
which our profane hours here have thrown down.	
the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw	
take the correction mildly, kiss the rod,	
the time shall not be many hours of age	
king richard. doubly divorc'd! bad men, you violate	
my wife to france, from whence set forth in pomp,	
she came adorned hither like sweet may,	
sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day.	
king richard. ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.	
northumberland. that were some love, but little policy.	
so, now i have mine own again, be gone.	
'jesu preserve thee! welcome, bolingbroke!'	
york. as in a theatre the eyes of men	
did scowl on gentle richard; no man cried 'god save him!'	
lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.	
aumerle. if god prevent not, i purpose so.	
enter a servant	
york. give me my boots, i say; saddle my horse.	
duchess. strike him, aumerle. poor boy, thou art amaz'd.	
i would appeach him.	
but now i know thy mind: thou dost suspect	
york. make way, unruly woman!                             exit	
duchess. after, aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;	
i'll not be long behind; though i be old,	
i doubt not but to ride as fast as york;	
with unrestrained loose companions,	
aumerle. where is the king?	
bolingbroke. what means our cousin that he stares and looks	
to have some conference with your grace alone.	
[kneels]	
if on the first, how heinous e'er it be,	
york. [within] my liege, beware; look to thyself;	
and thy abundant goodness shall excuse	
bolingbroke. our scene is alt'red from a serious thing,	
duchess. o king, believe not this hard-hearted man!	
duchess. sweet york, be patient. hear me, gentle liege.	
his words come from his mouth, ours from our breast.	
bolingbroke. good aunt, stand up.	
the word is short, but not so short as sweet;	
that would divorce this terror from my heart';	
and here is not a creature but myself,	
then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,	
nor i, nor any man that but man is,	
their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,	
in me it seems it will make wise men mad.	
for 'tis a sign of love; and love to richard	
groom. so proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.	
groom. my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.	
bolingbroke. we thank thee, gentle percy, for thy pains;	
that sought at oxford thy dire overthrow.	
i hate the murderer, love him murdered.	
come, mourn with me for what i do lament,	
king richard iii	
richard, duke of gloucester, afterwards king richard iii	
duke of norfolk	
marquis of dorset and lord grey, her sons	
duchess of york, mother to king edward iv	
lords, gentlemen, and attendants; priest, scrivener, page, bishops,	
our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings,	
to fright the souls of fearful adversaries,	
cheated of feature by dissembling nature,	
that dogs bark at me as i halt by them-	
clarence. his majesty,	
and says a wizard told him that by g	
antony woodville, her brother there,	
if we will keep in favour with the king,	
a cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;	
well are you welcome to the open air.	
but i shall live, my lord, to give them thanks	
'tis very grievous to be thought upon.	
till george be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven.	
as for another secret close intent	
whilst i awhile obsequiously lament	
th' untimely fall of virtuous lancaster.	
and that be heir to his unhappiness!	
more miserable by the death of him	
come, now towards chertsey with your holy load,	
from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells;	
which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.	
anne. villain, thou knowest nor law of god nor man:	
gloucester. but i know none, and therefore am no beast.	
of these supposed crimes to give me leave	
by circumstance but to acquit myself.	
anne. in thy foul throat thou liest: queen margaret saw	
o, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!	
so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom.	
anne. his better doth not breathe upon the earth.	
anne. why, that was he.	
anne. where is he?	
anne. would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!	
like trees bedash'd with rain-in that sad time	
for kissing, lady, not for such contempt.	
speak it again, and even with the word	
even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;	
and if thy poor devoted servant may	
tressel and berkeley, go along with me.	
gloucester. bid me farewell.	
i'll have her; but i will not keep her long.	
ha!	
on me, that halts and am misshapen thus?	
i will maintain it with some little cost.	
therefore, for god's sake, entertain good comfort,	
grey. the heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son	
river. is it concluded he shall be protector?	
and loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd	
bear with her weakness, which i think proceeds	
lords?	
cheerfully.	
with him?	
buckingham. ay, madam; he desires to make atonement	
between the duke of gloucester and your brothers,	
that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.	
to be so baited, scorn'd, and stormed at.	
queen margaret. out, devil! i do remember them to	
i was a pack-horse in his great affairs,	
thine.	
let me put in your minds, if you forget,	
ay, and forswore himself-which jesu pardon!-	
i would to god my heart were flint like edward's,	
i am too childish-foolish for this world.	
i can no longer hold me patient.                 [advancing]	
hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out	
queen margaret. what, were you snarling all before i came,	
their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,	
and see another, as i see thee now,	
hag.	
queen margaret. and leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou	
and then hurl down their indignation	
thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st,	
thou rag of honour, thou detested-	
queen margaret. i call thee not.	
that thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.	
queen margaret. to serve me well you all should do me	
o, that your young nobility could judge	
they that stand high have many blasts to shake them,	
as it is won with blood, lost be it so!	
and in that shame still live my sorrow's rage!	
look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,	
sin, death, and hell, have set their marks on him,	
rivers. a virtuous and a christian-like conclusion,	
the secret mischiefs that i set abroach	
warrant,	
for clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps	
we go to use our hands and not our tongues.	
i would not spend another such a night	
keeper. what was your dream, my lord? i pray you	
tell me.	
methoughts i saw a thousand fearful wrecks,	
o god! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,	
[clarence sleeps]	
first murderer. why, then he'll say we stabb'd him	
hold me but while one tells twenty.	
first murderer. remember our reward, when the deed's	
it is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing;	
to himself and live without it.	
clarence. thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.	
who sent you hither? wherefore do you come?	
and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.	
what lawful quest have given their verdict up	
i charge you, as you hope to have redemption	
second murderer. and that same vengeance doth he hurl	
o, know you yet he doth it publicly.	
clarence. o, do not slander him, for he is kind.	
to do this deed will hate you for the deed.	
a begging prince what beggar pities not?	
well, i'll go hide the body in some hole,	
for this will out, and then i must not stay.            exit

among this princely heap, if any here,

and shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?	
the mighty warwick and did fight for me?	
frozen almost to death, how he did lap me	
all thin and naked, to the numb cold night?	
sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you	
enter the old duchess of york, with the son and daughter of clarence	
son. why do you look on us, and shake your head,	
with earnest prayers all to that effect.	
bade me rely on him as on my father,	
enter queen elizabeth, with her hair about her	
i'll join with black despair against my soul	
queen elizabeth. to make an act of tragic violence.	
and liv'd with looking on his images;	
ah for my husband, for my dear lord edward!	
duchess. alas for both, both mine, edward and clarence!	
i for an edward weep, so do not they.	
with dull unwillingness to repay a debt	
buckingham. you cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing	
now cheer each other in each other's love.	
the broken rancour of your high-swol'n hearts,	
forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fet

hastings. on what occasion, god he knows, not i,	
have taken sanctuary. the tender prince	
oft have i heard of sanctuary men;	
but sanctuary children never till now.	
prince. good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.	
for your best health and recreation.	
prince. i do not like the tower, of any place.	
buckingham. he did, my gracious lord, begin that place,	
gloucester.  [aside]  so wise so young, they say, do never	
[aside]  thus, like the formal vice, iniquity,	
gloucester.  [aside]  short summers lightly have a forward	
prince. a beggar, brother?	
gloucester. a greater gift than that i'll give my cousin.	
gloucester. it is too heavy for your grace to wear.	
gloucester. how?	
uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;	
but come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,	
not he?	
and give us notice of his inclination;	
catesby. my good lords both, with all the heed i can.	
gloucester. chop off his head-something we will	
besides, he says there are two councils kept,	
but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?	
to bar my master's heirs in true descent,	
i'll send some packing that yet think not on't.	
catesby. 'tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,	
to princely richard and to buckingham.	
catesby. the princes both make high account of you-	
come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?	
i would be so triumphant as i am?	
pray god, i say, i prove a needless coward.	
hastings. go on before; i'll talk with this good fellow.	
hastings. i tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now	
hastings. gramercy, hastings; there, drink that for me.	
your friends at pomfret, they do need the priest:	
come, will you go?	
bishop of ely. your grace, we think, should soonest know	
hastings. i thank his grace, i know he loves me well;	
gloucester. my noble lords and cousins an, good morrow.	
gloucester. than my lord hastings no man might be	
bolder;	
exeunt gloucester and buckingham	
for i myself am not so well provided	
re-enter the bishop of ely	
when that he bids good morrow with such spirit.	
for, were he, he had shown it in his looks.

and i myself secure in grace and favour.	
who builds his hope in air of your good looks	
hastings. o bloody richard! miserable england!	
i prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee	
that ever wretched age hath look'd upon.

gloucester. come, cousin, canst thou quake and change	
gloucester. catesby, o'erlook the walls.	
that, his apparent open guilt omitted,

nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:	
gloucester. if you thrive well, bring them to baynard's	
castle;	
gloucester. go, lovel, with all speed to doctor shaw.

eleven hours i have spent to write it over,	
here's a good world the while! who is so gros

he is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,	
not dallying with a brace of courtezans,	
but, sure, i fear we shall not win him to it.	
now, catesby, what says his grace?	
lend favourable ear to our requests,	
your right of birth, your empery, your own.	
or bitterly to speak in your reproof	
yet so much is my poverty of spirit,	
which god defend that i should wring from him.	
seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree

buckingham. refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.	
i cannot nor i will not yield to you.

thy mother's name is ominous to children.	
if thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
